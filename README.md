# StudyTrackerAiProject
first attempt at using ai to tell if someone is studying or being distracted by a phone.
part of a group project for IT254 hardware and software concepts class

Will be using the following:
Google Teachable, Arduino, Camera, Lights, Buzzer/Speaker

This project will attempt to help the user study by alerting them to distracting behavior and offering encouragement
the user will aim the camera at themselves while studying and the ai model will determine if they are focused on 
their work or if they are interacting with distractions such as a phone. if a distraction is seen the buzzer and lights
will annoy the user into refocusing on their work with varying levels of stimulus. During prolonged focused periods the ai 
will send encouraging messages to keep them motivated

currently in the process of developing a proof of concept with limited ai modeling and basic components.
